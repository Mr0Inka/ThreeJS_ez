# ThreeJS_ez

Easy to use, really basic OBJ viewer with ThreeJS.  

- Models (.obj) go into /assets/model/
- Textures be used automatically if they are also in /assets/model/ (need to share a name with the .obj and be in .png)
- If a model has no texture provided, missing.png will be mapped onto it instead

Install nodeJS and express, then run server.js and head to localhost:8080 in your browser.  

Tested in Chrome.
